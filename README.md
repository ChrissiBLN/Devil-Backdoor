This is a simple backdoor made to control computers in various public institutions, like school library, internet caf√©, and so on.

## How to use it?

First, you need to make sure that all computers are connected to the same shared folder. You must put the **Devil-Server.exe** _(You can rename this file for something less troubling)_ and the **config.ini** _(This file can not be renamed)_ in the same folder, at any place on the hard drive of the computer.
